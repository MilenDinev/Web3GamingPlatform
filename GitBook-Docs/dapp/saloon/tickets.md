# ðŸŽŸ Tickets

**Saloon, the place where we will offer a range of exhilarating games, including some with a gamified element, will be accessible in various ways for users to enjoy them.**&#x20;

**You will have the option to play using our DAO Token, AVAX, or Tickets.**&#x20;

**Tickets come in four different types: bronze, silver, gold, and premium.**&#x20;

**Acquiring tickets can be done through various methods.**&#x20;

**For instance, owners of the G Minions will receive a weekly allocation of tickets based on the rarity of the NFTs they hold.**&#x20;

**These received tickets can only be used within the same week they were received.**&#x20;

**If a user owns multiple G Minions, they will receive tickets for each NFT they own, with the type of tickets being determined by the rarity of the G Minions they possess.**&#x20;

**Additionally, premium tickets can only be obtained through private events, not by holding an NFT.**

**Each type of ticket holds a different value within the Saloon games, and we will share more detailed information about their specific usage soon.** [**Stay tuned**](https://discord.com/invite/dPNE6fK4S4) **for updates on how to make the most of your tickets and maximize your gaming experience!**
