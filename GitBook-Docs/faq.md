### **How does blockchain work?**&#x20;

Blockchain uses cryptography to create a secure, decentralized database of transactions. Each block in the chain contains a digital signature, timestamp, and transaction data, and is connected to the previous block in the chain, creating a permanent and tamper-proof record of all transactions.

### **What are some use cases for blockchain?**&#x20;

Blockchain has a variety of use cases, including digital identity verification, supply chain management, voting systems, and secure peer-to-peer transactions.

### **Is blockchain the same as cryptocurrency?**&#x20;

No, blockchain is the technology that enables cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to function. Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset that are secured and managed using blockchain technology.
