## 4.Governance Token Research and Concept Development (Q2, 2023)

The first step in launching a governance token is to conduct research on the current state of the market and identify the target audience for the token. This involves researching other governance tokens in the market and identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Once this research is complete, the concept for the governance token can be developed.

## 5.Governance Token Smart Contract Development - (Q2, 2023)

The next step is to develop the smart contract for the governance token. This includes determining the token's supply, distribution, and allocation. Additionally, the smart contract will include the mechanisms for staking, voting, and rewards distribution.

## 6.Security Audit - (Q2, 2023)

Before launching the governance token, it is essential to conduct a thorough security audit of the smart contract. This is to ensure that the token's smart contract is secure and free from vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers.

## 7.Governance Token Distribution - (Q3, 2023)

Once the marketing and community building efforts are underway, the token distribution can begin. This includes conducting the token sale or airdrop, depending on the token's distribution mechanism. The distribution should be designed to ensure a fair distribution of tokens to interested parties.

## 8.Launch of Governance Mechanisms - (Q3, 2023)

The governance mechanisms, such as staking, voting, and rewards distribution, should be launched at this stage. This will allow token holders to participate in the governance of the ecosystem and earn rewards for their contributions.

## 9.In-Game Tokens Smart Contracts Development(Q4, 2023)

The next step is to develop the smart contract for the two in-game tokens - G token and mini games Tickets which can be used and received as rewards in our Mini Games section and later in the Main Game. This includes determining the tokens supply, distribution, and allocation. Additionally, the smart contracts will include mechanisms for rewards distribution.

## 10.Website Development - (Q2, 2023 - Q3, 2024 )

After the smart contracts are developed, the website development process can begin. This includes building the website's user interface, integrating the smart contracts, and developing the website's mechanics. It also involves creating the website's visual assets, including landing pages, marketplace, and user dashboard.

## 11.Mini Gamified Games Development - (Q3-Q4, 2023)

After the website and Genesis NFT collection are complete, the mini-gamified games development process can begin. This includes building the games user interface, integrating the smart contracts, and developing the games mechanics.

## 12.Miners NFT Collection - (Q2-Q3, 2023)

### Concept Development - (Q2, 2023)
   The first step in creating a Miners NFT Collection is to determine the types of miners that will be included in the collection. This involves researching the game mechanics and identifying the different types of miners that players can use to mine the in-game token. Once the types of miners are identified, the concept for the NFT collection can be developed, including the design, attributes, and rarity of each NFT.
    
### Design and Development - (Q2-Q3, 2023)
   The next step is to design and develop the NFTs for the Miners NFT Collection. This involves creating unique and attractive designs for each NFT and determining their attributes, such as mining speed, durability, and efficiency. The NFTs can also be given different levels of rarity based on their attributes and design.
    
### Smart Contract Development and Launching - (Q3, 2023)
   Once the NFT designs are complete, the smart contract for the Miners NFT Collection can be developed. This involves determining the number of NFTs in the collection and their distribution mechanism.

## 13.Lands NFT Collection Concept and Planning - (Q3, 2023 - Q1, 2024)

### Concept and Planning - (Q3, 2023)

The main game development process will begin once the website, NFT collections, and mini-gamified games are complete. This includes building the game's user interface, integrating the smart contracts, and developing the game's mechanics. The game will be based on the Wild West theme, where players can own land and mines that can be used to mine the in-game token. The game mechanics will include mining, trading, battling, and crafting.

## 17.Deployment and Launch - (Q3, 2025)
Once the game and ecosystem components are complete, the final step is to deploy them on the Avalanche network and launch them to the public.
